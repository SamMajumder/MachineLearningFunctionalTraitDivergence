  - **Figure 1** Complete workflow of the entire analysis procedure. The data was divided into a training and a test dataset by random sampling, whereby 70% of the data was used for training and 30% was used for testing. Missing data was imputed using a random forest algorithm using the R function rfImpute from the package randomForest. A random forest classifier was applied to the imputed training data (Train Imputed) and the traits were ranked based on Gini Importance. A recursive feature elimination method was implemented on the imputed training data and the optimal subset of ecologically relevant traits for species diversification was identified. The traits that were not in the optimal subset were excluded from both the training (Train optimal) and the test dataset (Test optimal). Two predictive models were trained on this reduced training dataset (Train optimal). One predictive model was built using the random forest (RF) classifier while the other one was built using the gradient boosting machine (GBM). These two models were validated using the test dataset (Test optimal) and compared with each other using metrics like overall accuracy, precision, recall and the F1 score.

## üîç Key Findings

- **Trait Importance for Species Classification:** The study identified key traits for accurate species classification at both genus and clade levels. Important traits include leaf size, shape, trichome density, and whole plant reproductive phenology. Traits like leaf nutrient chemistry, gas exchange, and floral morphology were generally less important.

- **Differences in Trait Importance Across Scales:** There were notable differences in the importance of various traits when comparing genus and clade levels. For instance, leaf lifespan was more significant at the genus level, while traits like leaf area and photosynthetic rate varied in importance across different clades.

- **Identification of Strongly Divergent Traits:** Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), the study pinpointed a core set of ecophysiological traits that are highly divergent across species. These include leaf size, shape, trichome density, and aspects of whole plant reproductive phenology and biomass.

- **Model Performance in Species Classification:** Classification models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), were used to validate the findings. These models showed high overall accuracy (ranging from 91.3% to 96.3%) in classifying species based on the identified traits, demonstrating the effectiveness of these traits in species differentiation.
